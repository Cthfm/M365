# Defender XDR Overview

## Overview

Microsoft Defender XDR is a unified defense suite that integrates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, and applications. It coordinates protection using insights from various Microsoft security products like Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365, Defender for Identity, and more. This integration enables security teams to view the full scope of threats, determine their impact, and take automated actions to stop and remediate attacks. It features a centralized view for monitoring, a combined incidents queue, cross-product threat signals, and automated self-healing capabilities for compromised devices, identities, and mailboxes. Security teams can also conduct detailed threat hunting using historical data.
