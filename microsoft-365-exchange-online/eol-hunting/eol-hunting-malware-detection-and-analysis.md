Malware delivered through email is another major threat in Exchange Online. Attackers use phishing emails, infected attachments, or malicious links to spread malware such as ransomware or Trojans.

### **Malware Indicators to Look For:**

* **Suspicious Attachments:** Emails containing unusual file types (e.g., .exe, .js, or macro-enabled files like .docm).
* **Unusual Email Activity:** Sudden surges in email activity from a userâ€™s mailbox, such as mass emailing of infected attachments.

### **Using Message Trace to Identify Specific Emails:**

* Message Trace can be used to identify emails containing suspicious attachments or links.

### **Using Safe Attachments and Safe Links for Malware Detection:**

* Safe Attachments will automatically analyze and sandbox suspicious attachments, helping you detect malware in its early stages.
* Safe Links will log clicks on malicious URLs, which could be leading users to download malware.

### **Analyzing Malware Detected by Defender for Office 365:**
