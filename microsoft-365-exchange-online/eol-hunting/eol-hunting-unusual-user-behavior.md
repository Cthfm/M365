# EOL Hunting: Unusual User Behavior

#### **Detecting Unusual User Behavior**

Unusual user behavior, such as mass message deletions or changes to mailbox settings, can be an indicator of either insider threats or compromised accounts.

**Key Topics:**

1. **Indicators of Unusual User Behavior:**
   * **Mass Deletions:** Large volumes of message deletions or emptying of the trash can be a sign that a user is trying to cover their tracks.
   * **Changes to Mailbox Permissions:** Unauthorized changes to mailbox permissions, such as granting access to external users or setting up delegation.
   * **Unusual Sending Patterns:** Abnormally high volume of sent emails, especially with suspicious content or attachments.
2. **Using Mailbox Audit Logs to Detect Mass Deletions:**
   * Review audit logs for mass deletions or suspicious activity.
3. **Detecting Changes in Mailbox Permissions:**
   * Investigate any changes to mailbox permissions, especially if permissions are being granted to users outside the organization.
4. **Tracking Abnormal Sending Patterns:**
   * Monitor sent items and outbound email flow for suspicious activity, such as bulk emails containing sensitive information or malware.
5. **Threat Hunting Insight:**
   * **Insider Threat Detection:** Investigating changes to mailbox settings or large-scale deletions can uncover insider threats or malicious behavior by compromised accounts.
