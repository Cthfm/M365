## **Overview**

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is an advanced security solution that protects Microsoft 365 users from email-based threats (phishing, malware, business email compromise), malicious links, and unsafe file attachments. It integrates directly with Exchange Online and is part of Microsoftâ€™s layered security model, which starts with **Exchange Online Protection (EOP)** and extends through **Defender for Office 365**.

### Protection Types:

* **EOP**: Basic email protection (anti-spam, anti-malware, spoofing, and outbound spam filtering).
* **Defender for Office 365 Plan 1**: Adds zero-day malware protection, advanced phishing protection (e.g., user and domain impersonation), Safe Attachments, and Safe Links to block malicious content in emails and collaboration tools like SharePoint and Teams.
* **Defender for Office 365 Plan 2**: Includes all Plan 1 features but also adds attack simulation, threat hunting tools (like **Threat Explorer** and **Threat Trackers**), and **Automated Investigation and Response (AIR)** to automate threat remediation. It also allows advanced incident response and security automation.

### **Defender for Office 365 Plan Comparison**

1. **Plan 1**:
   * **Prevent and Detect**: Protection against phishing, domain impersonation, advanced malware via Safe Attachments and Safe Links.
   * **Investigate and Respond**: Real-time detections, email entity pages, SIEM integration for better visibility into threats.
   * **Collaboration Tools Protection**: Safe Attachments and Safe Links extend to SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.
2. **Plan 2**:
   * **Prevent and Detect**: Adds **Attack Simulation Training** to test and train users on phishing and other attack vectors.
   * **Investigate and Respond**: Includes **Threat Explorer**, **Threat Trackers**, and **Automated Investigation and Response (AIR)**. These help proactively hunt for threats and automate post-breach investigations.
   * **Advanced Security**: Plan 2 also integrates with **Microsoft Defender XDR** (Extended Detection and Response), which enables cross-platform threat detection, incident review, and response automation.

### **Key Features of Each Plan**

* **Plan 1**:
  * Anti-phishing policies with impersonation protection.
  * Safe Links and Safe Attachments for Office clients, email, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams.
  * Real-time threat detection.
  * Email entity page to investigate suspicious activity.
  * SIEM integration for custom threat monitoring.
* **Plan 2**:
  * All of the above plus **Attack Simulation Training**, allowing admins to simulate phishing and malware attacks to train users.
  * **Threat Explorer** and **Threat Trackers** for advanced investigation and hunting capabilities.
  * **Automated Investigation and Response (AIR)** for compromised users and suspected malicious activity.
  * **Microsoft Defender XDR** integration for holistic incident management across email and endpoints.

### **Integration with Microsoft Defender XDR**

Defender for Office 365, especially in Plan 2, integrates with **Microsoft Defender XDR**, allowing users to detect, investigate, and respond to incidents beyond just email (e.g., across devices, cloud apps, etc.). This broader scope helps businesses consolidate their security operations under a unified platform.
