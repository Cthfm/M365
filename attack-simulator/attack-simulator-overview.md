# Attack Simulator Overview

## Overview

The **Microsoft 365 Attack Simulator** is a built-in feature designed to help organizations test and assess their security posture by simulating real-world attack scenarios. It allows administrators to run various types of simulated attacks to gauge how well users and security controls respond to threats. Here’s an overview of its key features and use cases:

### Key Features of Microsoft 365 Attack Simulator

1. **Phishing Attack Simulation**:
   * **Spear Phishing (Credential Harvesting)**: Simulates phishing attacks aimed at collecting user credentials. Users receive deceptive emails asking them to provide login information or other sensitive data.
   * **Spear Phishing (Attachment-based)**: Simulates phishing emails containing malicious attachments designed to infect the user’s device.
   * **Link-in-Email Phishing**: Sends simulated phishing emails that contain a malicious link to gauge how many users click on it.
2. **Password Spray Attack Simulation**:
   * This attack type simulates using commonly known passwords or weak passwords across many accounts in an attempt to gain unauthorized access. This tests the strength of password policies and user awareness around password security.
3. **Brute Force Password Attack Simulation**:
   * Simulates an attack where the attacker systematically attempts to guess user passwords by repeatedly trying combinations until successful. This helps organizations assess the resilience of their password policies.
4. **User Behavior Insights**:
   * The attack simulator provides detailed reports on user behavior during the simulated attack. This includes metrics such as how many users clicked on phishing links, submitted credentials, or opened malicious attachments. This data can be used to improve user education and awareness programs.
5. **Training and Recommendations**:
   * Based on the results of the simulated attacks, the simulator provides recommendations to enhance security. It might suggest implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), tightening password policies, or providing user security awareness training.
6. **Automated Campaigns**:
   * Admins can create automated phishing campaigns to regularly test employees over a period. The campaigns are customizable, allowing the selection of email templates, users to target, and attack types to simulate.

### Benefits of Microsoft 365 Attack Simulator

* **Improved User Awareness**: By simulating phishing and other attacks, users become more aware of the types of threats they may encounter. This leads to better security behavior, such as recognizing phishing attempts or reporting suspicious emails.
* **Security Posture Assessment**: It helps assess the effectiveness of security configurations and controls within the Microsoft 365 environment, particularly regarding password policies, MFA, and email security measures.
* **Compliance and Auditing**: For organizations with compliance needs, running regular simulations demonstrates a proactive stance toward security testing and preparedness, which can be beneficial during audits.
* **Training Integration**: The simulator is often integrated with Microsoft Defender for Office 365, which can provide post-simulation training for users who fail the tests. This allows for targeted educational efforts.

### Example Use Case

Imagine you're managing security for a financial services firm. You can simulate a **credential harvesting phishing attack** targeting a group of users, and the simulator would send out an email that looks like a legitimate login page but is intended to collect user credentials. After the attack simulation concludes, you’d review which users clicked the link or submitted their login details. From there, you could trigger security training or tighten security measures such as enforcing stricter MFA policies.

### Integration with Microsoft Defender for Office 365

The Attack Simulator is part of **Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (Plan 2)** and works in conjunction with its threat protection services. This integration allows organizations to proactively identify vulnerabilities and improve security protocols based on simulation results.
