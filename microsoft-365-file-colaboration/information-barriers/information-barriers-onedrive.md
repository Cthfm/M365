# Information Barriers: OneDrive

## Overview

Information Barriers (IB) in OneDrive, part of Microsoft Purview, enforce compliance by restricting collaboration between specific user groups. IB policies assign **segments** (like HR or Finance) to users, dictating who can share or access files. Admins manage OneDrive through **four IB modes**:

* **Open**: No restrictions on sharing.
* **Explicit**: Files can only be shared with matching segments.
* **Owner Moderated**: A site owner controls access for incompatible users.
* **Mixed**: Allows collaboration between segmented and unsegmented users.

These policies ensure security and compliance, especially for regulated industries. More details are available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/information-barriers-onedrive).
