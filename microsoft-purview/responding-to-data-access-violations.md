# Responding to Data Access Violations

## **Overview**

When sensitive data is accessed in violation of organizational policies, quick detection and response are critical to mitigating potential security risks. In this lesson, we will explore how to respond to data access violations using Microsoft Purview, including how to detect unauthorized access, investigate incidents, and implement automated responses through playbooks. This lesson will provide practical steps and strategies to address data access violations and protect your organization’s sensitive information.

## **What is a Data Access Violation?**

A **data access violation** occurs when a user or system accesses sensitive data in a way that violates organizational policies or regulatory requirements. This can include:

* **Unauthorized access**: When a user or system accesses data they are not permitted to view or modify.
* **Misuse of privileged access**: When an authorized user abuses their access to sensitive data, such as accessing or sharing confidential information inappropriately.
* **Data exfiltration**: When sensitive data is copied, moved, or shared with unauthorized external parties.

Data access violations pose a serious security risk, especially if they involve high-value or sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or intellectual property. Responding quickly and effectively to these violations is essential to prevent data breaches, legal repercussions, and damage to your organization’s reputation.

## **Detecting Data Access Violations in Microsoft Purview**

To respond to a data access violation, you first need to detect the violation in real time or as soon as possible. Microsoft Purview provides several tools for monitoring and detecting unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Step 1: Set Up Alerts for Sensitive Data**

You can configure alerts in Microsoft Purview to notify your security team when sensitive data is accessed in violation of policies. Here’s how to set up alerts for data access violations:

1. In the **Purview portal**, navigate to the **Policies** section.
2. Define **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies** that govern the handling of sensitive data (e.g., blocking unauthorized users from accessing or sharing data labeled as "Confidential" or "PII").
3. Enable **alerts** for specific policy violations, such as unauthorized access attempts, large data transfers, or data exports to unapproved systems.
4. Configure notifications to ensure that relevant stakeholders are alerted immediately when a violation occurs.

**Step 2: Monitor Access Logs and Insights**

Purview’s **audit logs** and **Insights** dashboards provide real-time monitoring of data access and usage patterns. You can use these logs to:

* **Identify unauthorized access attempts**: Audit logs will show when and by whom sensitive data was accessed, including any failed access attempts.
* **Track suspicious behavior**: Look for unusual access patterns, such as accessing large amounts of sensitive data or accessing data outside normal working hours.
* **Investigate user actions**: Drill down into specific users or systems that accessed data in violation of policy to understand their actions and motives.

By monitoring audit logs and receiving timely alerts, you can detect violations early and begin the investigation process immediately.

## **Investigating Data Access Violations**

Once a data access violation is detected, the next step is to conduct a thorough investigation to understand the scope of the incident and determine the appropriate response.

**Step 1: Review Audit Logs**

Audit logs in Purview provide detailed records of who accessed the data, when it was accessed, and what actions were taken. Here’s how to investigate using audit logs:

* **Filter by sensitive data**: Focus on audit logs related to the sensitive data that was violated. Look for details such as the user’s identity, the time of access, and whether the data was modified or shared.
* **Identify the user or system**: Determine whether the violator was an internal user, an external actor, or an automated system. This will help guide your response strategy (e.g., suspending a user’s account or blocking an external IP).
* **Analyze access patterns**: Look for abnormal access patterns, such as accessing large amounts of data in a short period, which could indicate data exfiltration.

**Step 2: Assess the Impact of the Violation**

After reviewing the logs, assess the impact of the violation:

* **Which data was accessed?**: Determine whether the accessed data contained sensitive information like PII, financial records, or intellectual property.
* **How was the data handled?**: Review whether the data was modified, copied, or shared with unauthorized parties. If data exfiltration occurred, you need to investigate where the data was transferred.
* **Were other systems compromised?**: If the violation involved multiple systems or users, you may need to widen the investigation to assess whether other systems or data were also compromised.

By thoroughly investigating the scope of the violation, you can make informed decisions about the appropriate response.

## **Responding to Data Access Violations**

Once the violation has been investigated, it’s time to take corrective actions to mitigate the impact and prevent further unauthorized access.

**Step 1: Revoke Access and Contain the Threat**

The first priority in responding to a data access violation is to stop the unauthorized access. Depending on the nature of the violation, you can take the following actions:

* **Revoke user access**: If the violation was caused by an internal user or compromised account, immediately revoke access to the sensitive data and any other critical systems.
* **Block external access**: If the violation involved an external actor, block the associated IP addresses or network connections to prevent further unauthorized access.
* **Isolate compromised systems**: If the data violation was part of a larger breach or system compromise, isolate the affected systems to prevent the attack from spreading.

**Step 2: Notify Relevant Stakeholders**

Depending on the severity of the violation, notify key stakeholders within your organization, including:

* **IT security team**: Ensure the security team is aware of the incident so they can assist with containment and investigation.
* **Data privacy or compliance teams**: If the accessed data is subject to regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR or HIPAA), notify the relevant privacy or compliance teams to assess the legal and regulatory impact.
* **Executive leadership**: In the case of a major data breach or violation with significant business impact, executive leadership should be informed.

**Step 3: Document the Incident**

Documenting the violation is critical for internal records, compliance, and future analysis. Key details to include in your incident report:

* **Date and time of the violation**.
* **Users or systems involved**.
* **Description of the data accessed**.
* **Actions taken to contain the threat**.
* **Next steps for remediation**.

By documenting the incident, you create a record that can be used for regulatory reporting, legal investigations, or internal security audits.

## **Automating Response with Playbooks**

To streamline the response process and ensure consistency, Microsoft Purview allows you to automate incident response actions using **Playbooks**. Playbooks are predefined workflows that execute specific actions when a violation occurs.

**Step 1: Create a Playbook in Microsoft Purview**

Here’s how to set up an automated Playbook for responding to data access violations:

1. In the **Purview portal**, navigate to the **Automation** section and select **Create Playbook**.
2. Define the conditions under which the Playbook will trigger (e.g., unauthorized access to data labeled as "Confidential").
3. Specify the actions to be taken when the Playbook is triggered, such as:
   * **Revoke user access**.
   * **Notify the security team** via email or a messaging system.
   * **Generate a report** of the violation and send it to key stakeholders.
4. Test the Playbook to ensure it functions as expected.

By automating the response process, Playbooks reduce the time it takes to respond to violations and ensure that critical actions are consistently performed.

**Step 2: Integrate Playbooks with Microsoft Sentinel**

For even more advanced automation, you can integrate Purview Playbooks with **Microsoft Sentinel**:

* When an alert for a data access violation is triggered in Purview, a Sentinel **Playbook** can automatically revoke user access, block IP addresses, and notify relevant teams.
* Sentinel’s advanced correlation capabilities allow you to combine data access violations with other security events (e.g., network anomalies) for more comprehensive incident response.

## **Best Practices for Responding to Data Access Violations**

1. **Set Up Real-Time Alerts**: Ensure that you have real-time alerts configured for any access to sensitive data, allowing you to respond to violations quickly.
2. **Automate Responses for High-Risk Data**: Use Playbooks to automate response actions for violations involving your most sensitive data, such as financial records or intellectual property.
3. **Regularly Review Incident Reports**: Periodically review the incident reports and logs to identify trends and potential gaps in your data access policies or security controls.
4. **Train Users on Data Policies**: Regularly educate users on the organization’s data access policies to reduce the likelihood of accidental violations or misuse of privileged access.
