# Purview and Threat Hunting

## **The Importance of Data Governance in Threat Hunting**

One of the primary challenges in threat hunting is the **sheer volume of data** that organizations generate daily. Data governance—the policies and processes that ensure data is managed effectively and securely—plays a pivotal role in this context. Without strong data governance, threat hunting becomes akin to finding a needle in a haystack, with little visibility into where sensitive data is stored or how it is accessed.

Microsoft Purview strengthens threat hunting by providing:

* **Visibility into data assets**: Knowing where sensitive data resides and how it flows through the organization is critical.
* **Data classification**: Categorizing data based on sensitivity levels allows for more focused threat hunting efforts, helping to prioritize high-risk assets.
* **Compliance enforcement**: Ensuring adherence to policies such as data access controls and encryption is vital in preventing misuse or leakage of data.

## **How Microsoft Purview Supports Threat Hunting**

Microsoft Purview serves as the foundation for threat hunting by offering **data discovery, classification, and auditing capabilities** that help identify abnormal patterns or breaches.

**Key Features of Microsoft Purview for Threat Hunting:**

1. **Data Discovery and Mapping**\
   Purview’s **Data Map** provides a real-time, comprehensive view of where data is stored and how it moves within the organization. This is essential for identifying:
   * Potential attack vectors.
   * Areas where sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized users.
   * Anomalies in data flow that could signal malicious activity.
2. **Sensitive Data Classification**\
   By using **sensitivity labels** and **classifications**, Purview helps threat hunters quickly locate high-risk data, such as personal identifiable information (PII), intellectual property, or financial records. This targeted approach allows for more efficient investigations by focusing on critical areas first.
3. **Audit Logs for Data Access Monitoring**\
   Purview generates detailed **audit logs** that track data access patterns across the organization. These logs are invaluable for detecting anomalies, such as:
   * Unusual data access from privileged accounts.
   * Data exfiltration attempts, where large volumes of sensitive data are accessed or moved unexpectedly.
   * Failed attempts to access restricted data, which could signal a breach attempt or insider threat.
4. **Integration with Microsoft Sentinel**\
   For a complete threat management solution, Purview can be integrated with **Microsoft Sentinel**, Microsoft’s security information and event management (SIEM) tool. This allows threat hunters to:
   * Correlate data access logs from Purview with broader network activity.
   * Set up real-time alerts for suspicious data access or policy violations.
   * Perform advanced threat hunting queries across integrated datasets.

## **Real-World Use Cases**

Here are a few examples of how Purview supports threat hunting in real-world scenarios:

* **Data Exfiltration Detection**: A company suspects that sensitive financial data is being leaked. By using Purview’s audit logs, threat hunters can identify whether sensitive files have been accessed unusually, and by whom.
* **Insider Threat Investigation**: A user with access to sensitive intellectual property has been behaving suspiciously. With Purview, the team can review data access logs, including attempts to download or share sensitive files, to determine if the individual is engaging in malicious activity.
* **Regulatory Compliance Monitoring**: In highly regulated industries like healthcare or finance, Purview helps ensure that sensitive data is accessed and stored in compliance with laws like GDPR or HIPAA. This provides threat hunters with clear evidence of compliance—or violations—that could signal data mishandling.

## **Microsoft Purview’s Unique Value in Threat Hunting**

Microsoft Purview stands out in threat hunting for several reasons:

* **Holistic View of Data**: Unlike traditional security tools that focus primarily on infrastructure or endpoints, Purview focuses on **data governance**. This makes it uniquely positioned to help organizations identify risks tied directly to sensitive data.
* **Seamless Integration**: Purview’s integration with Microsoft’s ecosystem (such as Sentinel, Defender, and Azure Active Directory) creates a seamless, unified threat hunting environment, providing insights that span both data security and network security.
* **Automation**: With Purview, security teams can automate many aspects of data governance and threat detection. Automated labeling, for instance, ensures sensitive data is protected the moment it’s created, reducing the likelihood of human error.
