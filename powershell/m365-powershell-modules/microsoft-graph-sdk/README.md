# Microsoft Graph SDK

## Overview

The **Microsoft Graph SDK** offers streamlined, real-time access to Microsoft 365 services like **Entra ID, Exchange Online, OneDrive, Teams**, and more. For security professionals, this SDK becomes a critical tool to **query logs, investigate threats, and automate incident response actions** across the organization. Its **unified API endpoint** simplifies data collection and enables automated remediation, making it invaluable for **threat detection, incident handling, and compliance monitoring**.

### **Key Use Cases for Threat Hunting and Security Operations**

#### 1. **Identity and Access Monitoring (Entra ID)**

* **Track risky sign-ins** to identify compromised credentials or unauthorized access attempts.
* **Monitor privileged accounts** to detect abnormal activity, like unusual login times or locations.
* Automate **account disablement** for compromised users during incident response.

**Use Case Example:** After identifying a phishing attempt, you can immediately block the user account to prevent lateral movement within the network.

#### 2. **Email Threat Hunting (Exchange Online)**

* **Search for phishing emails** across user inboxes to identify malicious content.
* Automate email quarantine to **remove dangerous messages** before they are opened.
* Investigate **mail flow patterns** to identify email spoofing attempts or suspicious senders.

**Use Case Example:** During a phishing investigation, you can retrieve all emails containing specific malicious links to understand the attack’s scope.

#### 3. **Audit and Log Review (Unified Audit Log)**

* **Query audit logs** to identify unusual file access, administrative actions, or privilege escalations.
* Correlate events across Microsoft 365 services, such as SharePoint and Teams, to **detect insider threats**.
* Continuously monitor **high-value assets** to ensure compliance and detect policy violations.

**Use Case Example:** Track unauthorized file downloads from SharePoint by users who normally wouldn’t access sensitive documents.

#### 4. **Incident Response Playbooks (Teams and Automation)**

* Integrate **Teams notifications** to alert analysts in real-time when threats are detected.
* Automate **incident response actions**, such as posting alerts to Teams or sending emails to the SOC.
* Use **Microsoft Graph data** to trigger workflows in **Logic Apps** or **Power Automate**, such as revoking risky sessions or isolating compromised users.

**Use Case Example:** If a high-risk sign-in is detected, an automated alert can post to the incident response channel in Teams, enabling immediate investigation.

#### 5. **Data Exfiltration Monitoring (OneDrive and SharePoint)**

* **Monitor large file uploads** to OneDrive for signs of data exfiltration.
* Track **external file sharing events** to identify potential insider threats or accidental data leakage.
* Automatically **revoke sharing links** or adjust permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

**Use Case Example:** If an employee unexpectedly uploads a large number of files to OneDrive during off-hours, an automated investigation can be initiated.

#### 6. **Behavioral Monitoring for Teams**

* Detect **malicious activity within Teams**, such as phishing attempts or suspicious links shared in chat channels.
* Monitor message patterns to **identify compromised accounts** engaging with internal employees.
* Post **automated alerts** to Teams channels when threats are identified for rapid collaboration among responders.

**Use Case Example:** If attackers attempt to use Teams to coordinate with insiders, you can detect these messages and alert the SOC immediately.

### **Integrating Microsoft Graph SDK into Security Operations**

#### **Proactive Threat Hunting and Automation**

With the ability to **query activity logs in real-time**, analysts can move beyond passive monitoring and engage in **proactive threat hunting**. Automating these queries ensures that security teams stay ahead of evolving threats by continuously scanning for risky behavior.

**Example in Practice:** Automate routine searches for risky sign-ins and alert on **impossible travel events**, where a user logs in from geographically distant locations within minutes.

#### **Automated Incident Response and Playbooks**

The Graph SDK integrates seamlessly with tools like **Logic Apps** or **Power Automate** to create **incident response playbooks**. These automated workflows allow for **immediate response actions**, such as:

* Disabling compromised accounts.
* Revoking active user sessions.
* Locking down file access during investigations.

#### **Enhanced Threat Detection through Cross-Service Visibility**

Graph SDK provides **cross-service visibility**, allowing you to correlate events across multiple Microsoft 365 services—like **combining email and identity data** to detect coordinated phishing attacks. This approach strengthens threat detection by **identifying patterns across platforms**.

### **Authentication and Security Considerations**

* **OAuth Authentication:** Use service principals or managed identities to ensure secure and scalable access.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Grant only the **necessary permissions** to align with the principle of least privilege.
* **Monitor API Usage Limits:** Be aware of rate limits to avoid interruptions during automation or bulk queries.

### **Best Practices for Security Analysts and Threat Hunters**

1. **Automate Repetitive Tasks:** Use the SDK to handle routine tasks like email quarantines, access monitoring, and phishing responses.
2. **Integrate with SIEM Tools:** Feed **Graph API data into your SIEM** for deeper analysis and event correlation.
3. **Create Real-Time Alerts:** Set up **Teams or email notifications** to keep analysts informed of threats immediately.
4. **Continuously Monitor Privileged Accounts:** Build automated workflows to flag unusual behavior on privileged accounts for faster incident response.
