# MITRE ATT\&CK Mitigations

Overview of MITRE ATT\&CK Mitigations

The MITRE ATT\&CK framework not only categorizes adversary tactics and techniques but also provides guidance on mitigations to help organizations defend against these threats. Mitigations are preventive measures that can reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of specific attack techniques. By implementing these mitigations, organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of successful cyberattacks. Here’s an overview of the key mitigations provided by the MITRE ATT\&CK framework:

#### Mitigations List: <a href="#mitigations-list" id="mitigations-list"></a>

1. **Application Isolation and Sandboxing**:
   * Isolate applications to prevent them from interacting with sensitive parts of the system or network, reducing the impact of exploits.
2. **Antivirus/Antimalware**:
   * Use antivirus and antimalware solutions to detect and block known malicious software and activities.
3. **Code Signing**:
   * Ensure all executable code is signed by a trusted source, making it harder for adversaries to introduce malicious code.
4. **Credential Hardening**:
   * Enforce strong, unique passwords, use multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regularly rotate credentials to protect against credential theft.
5. **Data Backup**:
   * Regularly back up critical data and ensure backups are stored securely and can be restored quickly in the event of data corruption or loss.
6. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**:
   * Deploy EDR solutions to monitor and respond to endpoint activities, providing visibility into potential threats and enabling rapid response.
7. **Firewalls**:
   * Use firewalls to control network traffic and block unauthorized access to critical systems and services.
8. **Network Segmentation**:
   * Divide the network into segments to limit lateral movement and contain the spread of attacks within specific zones.
9. **Patch Management**:
   * Regularly update and patch software and systems to fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries.
10. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
    * Limit user and system access to only what is necessary for their roles, reducing the potential impact of compromised accounts.
11. **Secure Configuration**:
    * Configure systems and software securely according to industry best practices and organizational policies to minimize vulnerabilities.
12. **Security Awareness and Training**:
    * Educate employees on security best practices, social engineering tactics, and how to recognize and report suspicious activities.
13. **Threat Intelligence**:
    * Utilize threat intelligence to stay informed about emerging threats and adjust defenses accordingly to mitigate identified risks.
14. **User Account Management**:
    * Implement strict user account management practices, including regular audits, to detect and prevent unauthorized access.
15. **Web Content Filtering**:
    * Use web content filtering to block access to malicious websites and prevent drive-by downloads and other web-based threats.
16. **Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**:
    * Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and automatically block or alert on detected threats.

By adopting these mitigations, organizations can proactively address potential vulnerabilities and reduce the likelihood of successful attacks. Each mitigation is designed to counter specific techniques used by adversaries, making it an essential part of a comprehensive defense strategy.

The MITRE ATT\&CK framework provides detailed information on how each mitigation can be applied to protect against various attack methods, helping organizations build resilient security defenses.
