* **Command and Control (C2)**:
  * **Objective**: Maintain communication with compromised systems.
  * **Techniques**: Web protocols, DNS, and encrypted channels are used to control compromised systems remotely.
* **Exfiltration**:
  * **Objective**: Steal data from your environment.
  * **Techniques**: Data can be exfiltrated via web services, automated exfiltration tools, or compressed before transfer to external locations.
* **Impact**:
  * **Objective**: Manipulate, interrupt, or destroy systems and data.
  * **Techniques**: This includes data destruction, service disruption, and defacement to cause operational harm.
* **Resource Development**:
  * **Objective**: Establish resources for future operations.
  * **Techniques**: Acquiring infrastructure, developing capabilities, and setting up accounts help adversaries prepare for attacks.
* **Reconnaissance**:
  * **Objective**: Gather information to plan future operations.
  * **Techniques**: This involves gathering information on targets, identifying potential victims, and collecting detailed target information.

### **2. Techniques** <a href="#id-2.-techniques" id="id-2.-techniques"></a>

* **Resource Development**:
  * **Examples of Techniques**: Acquiring infrastructure, developing capabilities, and setting up accounts.
* **Reconnaissance**:
  * **Examples of Techniques**: Gathering information on targets, identifying potential victims, and collecting detailed target information.

### **3. Procedures** <a href="#id-3.-procedures" id="id-3.-procedures"></a>

**Procedures** are the detailed, specific implementations of techniques used by adversaries. They describe exactly how a particular technique is executed. Procedures can vary widely even within the same technique, reflecting the diversity of methods attackers use in real-world scenarios.

**Example of a Procedure**:

* For the **Defense Evasion** technique under the **Impair Defenses** tactic, a procedure might involve disabling audit logging to prevent the recording of malicious activities, making it harder for security teams to detect the adversary's presence and actions.

### How MITRE ATT\&CK is Used <a href="#how-mitre-att-and-ck-is-used" id="how-mitre-att-and-ck-is-used"></a>

1. **Threat Detection**
2. **Incident Response**
3. **Security Gap Analysis**
4. **Threat Hunting**

### **1. Threat Detection** <a href="#id-1.-threat-detection" id="id-1.-threat-detection"></a>

By mapping detected activities and behaviors to the ATT\&CK framework, security teams can better understand the tactics and techniques being used by attackers. This helps in identifying suspicious patterns and indicators of compromise (IOCs).

**Example**:

* If unusual login attempts are detected from multiple IP addresses, this activity can be mapped to the **Brute Force** technique under the **Credential Access** tactic.

### **2. Incident Response** <a href="#id-2.-incident-response" id="id-2.-incident-response"></a>

During and after a security incident, the ATT\&CK framework helps incident responders to systematically analyze and categorize the attack. This structured approach aids in identifying the full scope of the breach and in developing effective containment and remediation strategies.

**Example**:

* Analyzing a malware attack can reveal multiple techniques used, such as **File Deletion** (Defense Evasion) and **Command and Scripting Interpreter** (Execution). Knowing these helps responders address all aspects of the incident.

### **3. Security Gap Analysis** <a href="#id-3.-security-gap-analysis" id="id-3.-security-gap-analysis"></a>

Organizations can use the ATT\&CK framework to assess their current security measures and identify gaps. By understanding which tactics and techniques are not adequately covered by existing defenses, they can prioritize improvements and investments in security controls.

**Example**:

* If an organization finds it lacks detection capabilities for the **Persistence** tactic, they might invest in tools and processes to monitor for unauthorized changes to user accounts or scheduled tasks.

### **4. Threat Hunting** <a href="#id-4.-threat-hunting" id="id-4.-threat-hunting"></a>

Threat hunters use the ATT\&CK framework to proactively search for signs of adversarial activity within their networks. By focusing on specific tactics and techniques, they can develop hypotheses and queries to uncover hidden threats.

**Example**:

* A threat hunter might investigate for signs of **PowerShell** usage (Execution technique) across their environment to find potential malicious activities leveraging this powerful scripting tool.
