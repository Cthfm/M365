### Introduction to the Threat Hunting Process <a href="#introduction-to-the-threat-hunting-process" id="introduction-to-the-threat-hunting-process"></a>

Threat hunting is a proactive and iterative security practice aimed at detecting and mitigating hidden threats. This section introduces the core stages of the threat hunting process: Hypothesis Generation, Investigation, Identification, and Resolution, emphasizing the importance of documentation and knowledge sharing.

### **Key Stages of the Threat Hunting Process** <a href="#key-stages-of-the-threat-hunting-process" id="key-stages-of-the-threat-hunting-process"></a>

1. **Hypothesis Generation**: Develop potential threat scenarios based on intelligence and historical data.
2. **Investigation**: Analyze data to validate or dismiss hypotheses using various tools and techniques.
3. **Identification**: Confirm threats by distinguishing actual dangers from false positives.
4. **Resolution**: Neutralize threats through isolation, remediation, and patching, followed by a post-hunt analysis to refine future hunts.

### **Iterative Nature of Threat Hunting** <a href="#iterative-nature-of-threat-hunting" id="iterative-nature-of-threat-hunting"></a>

Threat hunting is a cyclical process that evolves with each iteration, enhancing organizational security through continuous learning and adaptation.

### **Importance of Documentation and Knowledge Sharing** <a href="#importance-of-documentation-and-knowledge-sharing" id="importance-of-documentation-and-knowledge-sharing"></a>

Effective threat hunting relies on thorough documentation and the sharing of findings, which helps refine methods and strengthen security defenses.
