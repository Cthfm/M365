# Threat Hunting Introduction

## **Overview** <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The following section provides an overview of what threat hunting is and what it is in context to other security disciplines. It also identifies what successful hunting looks like.

### **Defining Threat Hunting** <a href="#defining-threat-hunting" id="defining-threat-hunting"></a>

* **Definition**: Threat hunting is the proactive search through networks, endpoints, and datasets to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. Unlike automated tools, it involves human-driven analysis and intuition to hypothesize about potential undetected threats.
* **Goals of Threat Hunting**: The primary goal is to improve detection and response times to threats before they cause harm, enhancing overall security posture.

### **Threat Hunting vs. Other Security Practices** <a href="#threat-hunting-vs.-other-security-practices" id="threat-hunting-vs.-other-security-practices"></a>

* **Incident Response**: Incident response is reactive, dealing with breaches after they occur. Threat hunting, conversely, is proactive, seeking to prevent breaches before they manifest.
* **Continuous Monitoring**: While continuous monitoring is about observing systems to react quickly to alerts, threat hunting involves actively seeking out the not-yet-identified threats that exist silently within an environment.
* **Table Comparison**: This section can include a table comparing threat hunting, incident response, and monitoring in terms of objectives, activities, tools used, and outcomes.

### **The Role of Threat Hunting in Cybersecurity** <a href="#the-role-of-threat-hunting-in-cybersecurity" id="the-role-of-threat-hunting-in-cybersecurity"></a>

* **Early Detection**: By identifying threats early, organizations can mitigate risks before they escalate into full-blown incidents.
* **Adaptation to Evolving Threats**: Threat hunting allows organizations to adapt their defense mechanisms to the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats, staying one step ahead of attackers.
* **Skill Development**: It cultivates a high level of analytical skills among security professionals, enhancing their ability to think like attackers.

### **Examples of Successful Threat Hunting** <a href="#examples-of-successful-threat-hunting" id="examples-of-successful-threat-hunting"></a>

* **Case Study 1**: A major retail company used threat hunting to detect a previously unknown type of malware that was siphoning credit card details, preventing millions in potential fraud.
* **Case Study 2**: How threat hunters in a government agency identified subtle signs of an advanced persistent threat (APT), enabling the organization to thwart a potential data breach involving sensitive political data.
